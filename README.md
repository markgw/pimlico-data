# Pimlico Data

Example datasets for [Pimlico](https://github.com/markgw/pimlico/>) demos, guides and tests.

The datasets are all either generated for the purpose or based on freely available corpora, distributed together with the appropriate license if applicable.

Small datasets for unit tests and module tests are distributed with the main Pimlico codebase. The datasets in this repository are kept separate, since they do not all need to be downloaded whenever you clone or download Pimlico.
